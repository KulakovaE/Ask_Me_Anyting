# Ask_Me_Anyting

This is a challange from a course that I am attending at Udemy.
The goal is to apply the skills I have learned about random presenting images from Assets.
I am making an Ask Me Anything app. You can ask the app to make all your difficult decisions. 
Should I order a Beef burrito or a Pepperoni Pizza with extra cheese? 
Should I watch Stranger Things or Game of Thrones? 
With this app in your pocket, you’ll always have an answer to life’s many conundrums!
